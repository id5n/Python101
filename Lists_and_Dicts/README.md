# Lists and Dicts

Lists and dicts help us store compound data.

## Lists

A list, as it sounds like, is used to store multiple bits of data in the same variable

```python
test_scores = [100, 68, 95, 84, 79, 99]
```

Here, we store multiple test scores within a single list. We can access individual scores by **index**:

```python
print(test_scores[0]) # 100
print(test_scores[3]) # 84
```

We use the `len` function to get the total length of items in that list

```python

print(len(test_scores)) # 6

```

We can update a list by

```python
list_ = []

list_.append(1) # [1]
list_.append(2) # [1,2]
```
